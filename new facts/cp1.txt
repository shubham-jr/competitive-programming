continue statment in for loop update iteration
int -10^9 to 10^9
long int -10^12 to 10^12
long long int -10^18 to 10^18
we cannot give size to set stl we can only use insert and find on it.
in pair we use make_pair to initialize pair
initializing any stl with same thing use "vector<pii>v(10,{1,2});" here in () give as 2nd argument....
if you donot give the size then the bounded for(:) loop doen't work because size is 0;
if you sort vector<pii> then it is sorted a/q to the first element if you want to sort a/q to second then use driver fn
also if you use sort in v<pii> and if the first element are same then it would use second element to sort
third parameter in sort is comparator function.(what you want to get return that)...
set<int> s(v.begin(), v.end()); copy vector into set //same as in miltiset
ends.erase(ends.begin())
insertion of map insert({key,value})
if you use pb then in vector always you got zer0 {0,1,....} if you have set the size of vector(n)
if you not set set the size of vector then use push_back not v[i] in for loop because loop not work
memset function is used to initialize varibale size objects and must be sequential and we can only initialize 0 ||-1;
problems-- int arr[9]={5}; wrong this luckily only work for {0};
problem int arr[n]={2} cannot initialize variable sized array
memset syntax memset(arr,-1or0,sizeof(arr)); h file cstring
sigsegv segmentation fault occur when you want to access out of limit(bound)
SIGABRT is commonly used by libc and other libraries to abort the program in case of critical errors. 
--For example, glibc sends an SIGABRT in case of a detected double-free or other heap corruptions.
--SIGABRT errors are caused by your program aborting due to a fatal error.
-- In C++, this is normally due to an assert statement in C++ not returning true, but some STL elements can generate this if they try to store too much memory.
default value of map before initialization is 0;m[1] gives 0;
if you want to initialize map using random value you can use (gfg link (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/default-values-in-a-map-in-c-stl/))---
---make a class/structure then specify value like int i=-1; then in map map[1].i gives -1 
set cannot be assingned by push back only use insert
vector not have push_front
you can use list if you want to push back/front etc because it just like double ended linked list
you cannot use list like l[0] no never because it is linked list
always use correct brackets in case of getting value from iterator (*(s.begin())).ff
maximum all cpp stl containers have begin() and end()
