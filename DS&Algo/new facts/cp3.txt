Never pass conatiners/objects(array,vectors) as copy(call by value) if not necessary.
vector of size 4*n if using segment tree in recursive manner if iterative then 2*n
How to use template in classes https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/templates-cpp/
if you have to find min&max try using binary search 
The largest integer data type in C/C++ is unsigned long long int which is of 64 bit and can handle integer from 0 to (2^64 – 1)
% only work on integers and sqrt,^ gives double 
int dp problem first solve it by recursion then memoization then use iteration with tabulation
stack size is 1mb in windows
recursion takes stack size of logn not n
initialize 2d vector vector<vector<int>>dp(x+1,vector<int>(n+1,-1));
vector<vector<int> > *varVect;
 //this is the vector pointer that need to hold the other vectors

modular mniltiplicative inverse like multiplicative inverse[(a/b)%c] prop:: a*x=1 mod c
don't use normal divison in case of modulo use above its multiplicative inverse
XOR properties a^b=c then a^c=b also c^b=a
a^0=a and a^a=0

void changeReferenceValue(int*& pp) reference to pointer
to accessing global and local variable of same name use ::(scope resolution operator)
how to find the type of any variable
{
  auto testVar = std::make_tuple(1, 1.0, "abc");
  decltype(testVar)::foo= 1;
}
retuns error: 'foo' is not a member of 'std::tuple<int, double, const char*>'
how to iterator through map map<int,int,greater<int>>::iterator it=m1.begin(); then it->first it->second
if you don't know how to store the data you have then use your own data types using class or structure like to store the triplet in vcetors
or storing triplets or more simply use tuple<int ,char,float>s;operations 1.get() 2.make_tuple ex get<0>(variable_name)
