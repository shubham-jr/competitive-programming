Never pass conatiners/objects(array,vectors) as copy(call by value) if not necessary.
vector of size 4*n if using segment tree in recursive manner if iterative then 2*n
How to use template in classes https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/templates-cpp/
if you have to find min&max try using binary search 
The largest integer data type in C/C++ is unsigned long long int which is of 64 bit and can handle integer from 0 to (2^64 â€“ 1)
% only work on integers and sqrt,^ gives double 
int dp problem first solve it by recursion then memoization then use iteration with tabulation
stack size is 1mb in windows
recursion takes stack size of logn not n
initialize 2d vector vector<vector<int>>dp(x+1,vector<int>(n+1,-1));
vector<vector<int> > *varVect;
 //this is the vector pointer that need to hold the other vectors
